                                <blockquote>Darius is an absolute pleasure to work with. We hired him for a
                                    crucial event and he over delivered in every way. Darius arrived early to
                                    capture details before guests arrived, discreetly took photos the entire
                                    evening,
                                    and sent a link for the finished photos within a week of our event. In
                                    addition to his stunning and thoughtful photos, Darius is kind, intelligent,
                                    and willing to jump in to ensure your event is a success. He takes
                                    direction well and thrives on feedback. I would recommend Darius not only
                                    for his many talents, but for the passion and integrity he brings to
                                    everything he does.

                                    volunteered for Year Up by being Class 20's photographer, showing an
                                    artistic
                                    interest as well.) The fearless part of Darius is how he is not afraid to

                                    undeterred. He would be a great employee for any industry! He will

                                    knowledge and advance himself.

                                    working with in all my life. I was his colleague during our journey through
                                    Year Up. He has such a wide array of technical knowledge that you would
                                    think
                                    he's a walking textbook. He's knowledgeable, but he's also personable. He
                                    likes to go above and beyond in his teamwork, bringing up as many others as
                                    he can on his journey up the corporate ladder. He will be an incredibly

                                    that is willing to do what it takes to get the job done.

                                    database, or platform you can think of, look no further. Darius is a highly
                                    skilled (and friendly) software architect. As a product manager, I needed
                                    help
                                    building a Chrome Extension to fit to modify our teams' software, but didn't
                                    have the technical skills to do it myself. Darius offered to help quickly
                                    rewrote a lot of the code to be understandable for non-engineers.
                                    Now I can customize our product management software just by adding few
                                    strings to the extension. I'm so grateful to have found Darius on Simbi. I
                                    highly suggest you reach out to him if you're having any issues with
                                    your code. He's very kind and communicative. You won't regret it!

                                    of knowing (and we've been through several interns in my time here!).
                                    Although his official focus here has been on the Desktop IT side, he has
                                    consistently
                                    demonstrated to me an incredible grasp of complex thinking, programming,
